# BMad Method

BMad is an agent-driven methodology for software development that leverages AI agents to streamline the planning and execution of projects. It is designed to be used in an IDE and integrates with your existing development workflow.

## Core Concepts

The BMad Method is built around a few core concepts:

*   **Agents:** BMad uses a team of AI agents, each with a specific role (e.g., Project Manager, Architect, Developer, QA). These agents perform tasks and collaborate to move the project forward.
*   **Plan and Execute Workflow:** The method is divided into two main phases: a planning phase and a development phase. The planning phase is for defining the project requirements and architecture, while the development phase is for implementing the features.
*   **Living Documentation:** Project documents like the PRD and Architecture are treated as living documents that are updated as the project evolves.
*   **Integrated QA:** The Test Architect (QA agent) is involved throughout the development lifecycle to ensure quality and prevent regressions.

## Workflows

The BMad Method defines two main workflows:

### Planning Workflow

The planning workflow is a structured process for defining the project requirements and architecture. It involves agents like the Analyst, Project Manager, and Architect. The output of this phase is a set of documents, including a PRD and an architecture design.

For more details, see the [User Guide](.bmad-core/user-guide.md).

### Core Development Cycle

The core development cycle is an iterative process for implementing stories. It involves agents like the Scrum Master, Developer, and QA. Each cycle involves drafting a story, implementing it, and running it through a quality gate.
